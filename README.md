# LibraryDatabase
This is my first javaFX project.
- You can add and remove books to the library.
- I have created a SQLite database that contains in each row informations of a book.
- The database uses a Singleton instance and custom queries to delete and add elements.
- To delete elements I added a new class that uses the Build pattern to create custom query that is passed to the main Database.
- The scene is build dynamically by using a custom sceneBuilder that I created.
